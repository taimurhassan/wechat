# Workshop on Embodied and Cognitive Health AI Technologies (WECHAT)

<p align="justify">
The aim of the Workshop on Embodied and Cognitive Health AI Technologies (WECHAT) is to explore and discuss the latest advancements at the intersection of embodied artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, and cognitive computing. More specifically, the focus of the workshop is on intelligent systems capable of sensing, reasoning, and acting in both clinical and remote healthcare environments. 
The workshop welcomes novel findings in the areas of:

  - AI-driven IoT and human-centric healthcare systems.
  - Cognitive AI to assist physicians in decision-making, diagnosis, and outcome prediction.
  - Multimodal sensor fusion (audio, visual, textual, and tactile) for telehealth and patient monitoring.
  - Federated learning, as well as lightweight and explainable AI, along with wearable healthcare systems that prioritize privacy.
  - Practical challenges of AI in healthcare.

The workshop invites researchers, engineers, clinicians and industrialists from various disciplines to submit their novel findings in an LNCS Springer format manuscript, ensuring the submission requirements of the conference main track.
